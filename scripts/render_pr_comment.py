"""Render a risk-scored PR comment from ``code-review-graph detect-changes`` JSON.

Reads the JSON document printed by ``code-review-graph detect-changes
--base <ref>`` (the full, non ``--brief`` output) and emits GitHub-flavoured
markdown suitable for a sticky pull-request comment. Also implements the
risk gate behind the composite action's ``fail-on-risk`` input.

The first line of the rendered body is a hidden HTML marker so the action
can find and update its own comment instead of posting a new one each run.

Exit codes:
    0  rendered successfully (gate passed or disabled)
    2  the input file could not be read
    3  risk gate breached (``--fail-on-risk high|critical``)
    4  detect-changes did not produce an analysis at all

Exit 4 exists because "no changes" and "could not determine the changes"
must not render as the same comment. ``detect-changes`` prints exactly
``No changes detected.`` for a genuinely clean tree and exits 0; anything
else non-JSON on its stdout means the analysis never happened, and a review
gate that rendered a reassuring comment for that would be waving through a
pull request nobody looked at.
